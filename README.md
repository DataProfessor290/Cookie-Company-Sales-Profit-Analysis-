## Data Cleaning Procedure

### **Objective**
Ensure data integrity, consistency, and proper formatting for accurate analysis and SQL storage.

### **Steps:**

1. **Duplicate the Dataset**
   - Created a copy of the original dataset to preserve raw data and prevent accidental modifications.
   - Worked exclusively on the duplicate to ensure data integrity.

2. **Check for Missing Values and Duplicate Rows**
   - Scanned the dataset for missing values and confirmed no data gaps exist.
   - Checked for duplicate rows and ensured no redundant records.
   - Since no missing values or duplicates were found, proceeded with further processing.

3. **Ensure "Unit Sold" Column Contains Integers**
   - Converted the "Unit Sold" column to an integer (int) data type.
   - Handled any non-integer values if necessary.

4. **Convert "Revenue," "Cost," and "Profit" Columns to Numeric Format**
   - Ensured "Revenue," "Cost," and "Profit" columns were numeric (float or decimal).
   - Removed any non-numeric characters (e.g., currency symbols or text errors).
   - Converted the cleaned data to a numeric format suitable for SQL storage.

5. **Convert the "Date" Column to Datetime Format**
   - Standardized the "Date" column by converting it to a datetime data type.
   - Ensured all values followed a consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD or equivalent).
   - Handled any incorrect or inconsistent date entries.

6. **Extract Month Name from "Date" Column**
   - Created a new "Month Name" column by extracting the monthâ€™s full name (e.g., "January").

7. **Create a Table for Analysis**
   - After duplicating the dataset, a table was created using the data array to facilitate pivot table and dashboard creation.
